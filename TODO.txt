In no particular order, here are things Geary does NOT do yet, but I am considering:

* When 5.3 drops, up LFD heroic from 435 to 440
* Geary_Inspect.itemCount and iLevelTotal for Interface_Player summary can be zero if last
  inspection attempt fails; e.g. player logs off. So the player interface shows some items,
  but then shows equipped item level of 0.
** Also shows milestone of "Until LFD heroic: 0 iLevels" when it should be 6960

* Store inspection results in a persistent database that can be viewed
** Option for storing only level 90
** Option for automatically pruning entries older than x days
** //Maybe:// Sync database entries with party, guild, or specific player
* List of inspection results with summary for people in your current group
* //Maybe:// Inspect all members of your group with one click
* Player interface improvements:
** //Maybe:// Add hyperlinks explaining what's missing in summary text
** //Maybe:// Add options to control the font of the summary text
** //Maybe:// Show empty sockets shown with their graphic
* Options:
** //Maybe:// Make options take effect immediately and have cancel revert to previous values
** //Maybe:// Options to configure mouse clicks for icon
* Detection:
** //Maybe:// Detect non-rare MoP gems and non-MoP enchants
** //Maybe:// Show items with PvP stats
** //Maybe:// Show items with inappropriate stats (e.g. Prot Paladin wearing Intellect gear)
** //Maybe:// Detect unspent talent points
** //Doubtful:// Detection of profession perks (e.g. enchants on rings, sockets in bracers/hands, etc)
* //Maybe:// Don't allow inspection while in combat and abort inspection if combat starts
* //Maybe:// Inspection results added to player tooltips
* //Maybe:// An optional minimap button that works like the icon and can integrate with Norganna SlideBar
* //Doubtful:// Resizing of Geary interface
* //Doubtful:// In player interface item tooltips, show set pieces of the inspected character, not you
