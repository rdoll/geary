In no particular order, here are things Geary does NOT do yet, but I am considering:

* When 5.3 drops, up LFD heroic from 435 to 440
* In 5.3, add Cloak of Virtue detection
* Geary_Inspect.itemCount and iLevelTotal for Interface_Player summary can be zero if last
  inspection attempt fails; e.g. player logs off. So the player interface shows some items,
  but then shows equipped item level of 0.
** Also shows milestone of "Until LFD heroic: 0 iLevels" when it should be 6960

** List of inspection results with summary for people in your current group
** Sort by clicking on column headers
** //Maybe:// Show date/time in locale specific format
