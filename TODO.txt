In no particular order, here are things Geary does NOT do yet, but I am considering:

* When 5.3 drops, up LFD heroic from 435 to 440
* Geary_Inspect.itemCount and iLevelTotal for Interface_Player summary can be zero if last
  inspection attempt fails; e.g. player logs off. So the player interface shows some items,
  but then shows equipped item level of 0.
  - Also shows milestone of "Until LFD heroic: 0 iLevels" when it should be 6960

* Store inspection results in a persistent database that can be viewed
* List of inspection results with summary for people in your current group

* //Maybe:// Inspect all members of your group with one click
* //Maybe:// Working hyperlinks in player interface summary text
* //Maybe:// Show empty sockets shown with their graphic in player interface
* //Maybe:// Make options take effect immediately and have cancel revert to previous values
* //Maybe:// Options to configure mouse clicks for icon
* //Maybe:// Don't allow inspection while in combat and abort inspection if combat starts
* //Maybe:// Detect non-rare MoP gems and non-MoP enchants
* //Maybe:// Show items with PvP stats
* //Maybe:// Show items with inappropriate stats for the character's current class/spec (e.g. Prot Paladin wearing Intellect gear)
* //Maybe:// Inspection results added to player tooltips
* //Maybe:// An optional minimap button that works like the icon and can integrate with Norganna SlideBar
* //Maybe:// Detect unspent talent points

* //Doubtful:// Resizing of Geary interface
* //Doubtful:// Detection of profession perks (e.g. enchants on rings, sockets in bracers/hands, etc)
* //Doubtful:// In player interface item tooltips, show set pieces of the inspected character, not you
