In no particular order, here are things Geary does NOT do yet, but I am considering:

* Geary_Inspect.itemCount and iLevelTotal for Interface_Player summary can be zero if last
  inspection attempt fails; e.g. player logs off. So the player interface shows some items,
  but then shows equipped item level of 0.
** Also shows milestone of "Until LFD heroic: 0 iLevels" when it should be 6960
* If you switch your current target while inspecting your target, the remaining inspection tries
  fail and wait for the timeout. Coupled with above, you get no useful data.
** Be nice if Geary detected target changed and aborted the inspection


Database example:

                           _ Tooltip shows class and spec name
                          |
Fac Name              Lv Spe Rol iLevel Items       Date Time                (trash can? red (X)?)
(H) Foamulon-Doomham  90 (B) (R) 123.45 Missing ##  05/12/13 16:32  (X)  <-- Poup confirms deletion
    ^                             ^      ^
	|_ Trimmed & in class color   |      |_ Tooltip shows summary of what's missing
                                  |
                                  |_ Tooltip shows item count and total ilevels

Group would be the same except:
- Instead of (X) to delete, have [Inspect] button to reinspect
- Show all members of the group. If no inspect data, show -'s for missing items and Date/Time as "Never"
- Show group summary

* Add Cloak of Virtue detection
* Database:
** Store inspection results for viewing and used for out-of-game parsing
** Delete All button
** Option for storing only level 90 results
** Option for automatically pruning entries older than x days
** Sort by clicking on column headers
** Filter results by Faction, Class, and Level
** //Maybe:// Show date/time in locale specific format
